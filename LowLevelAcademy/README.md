# LOW LEVEL ACADEMY PROJECTS

A collection of C programming projects focused on systems programming and low-level concepts


## Projects

### [Database System](database/README.md)
A custom binary database implementation with:
- CRUD operations for employee records
- Network-byte-order data storage
- Custom binary file format
- Command-line interface

### [Network Server](network/network/README.md)
A networked employee database system with client-server architecture:
- Poll-based server handling multiple simultaneous clients
- Custom binary protocol with state machine
- Persistent database storage
- Client application for database operations

### [Threadpool Example](threads/threadpool/README.md)
A minimal POSIX threadpool implementation:
- Static library and example program
- Task queue with worker threads
- Demonstrates thread synchronization and concurrency
- Simple Makefile for building and running

## Prerequisites

```bash
$ pacman -S gnu-netcat strace
```

These projects demonstrate foundational systems programming concepts including memory management, binary protocols, file I/O, networking, and multithreading.
