# LOW LEVEL ACADEMY PROJECTS

A collection of C programming projects focused on systems programming and low-level concepts.

## Projects

### [Database System](database/README.md)
A custom binary database implementation with:
- CRUD operations for employee records
- Network-byte-order data storage
- Custom binary file format
- Command-line interface

### [Network Server](network/network/README.md)
A networked employee database system with client-server architecture:
- Poll-based server handling multiple simultaneous clients
- Custom binary protocol with state machine
- Persistent database storage
- Client application for database operations

## Prerequisites

```bash
$ pacman -S gnu-netcat strace
```

Both projects demonstrate foundational systems programming concepts including memory management, binary protocols, file I/O, and networking.
