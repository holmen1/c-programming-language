# Network Server Project

A networked employee database system with client-server architecture:

## Core Components

- **Server (`dbserver`)**: 
  - Poll-based architecture handling multiple simultaneous clients
  - State machine for connection management (NEW ‚Üí HELLO ‚Üí MSG)
  - Persistent database storage
  - Clean signal handling for graceful shutdown

- **Client (`dbcli`)**:
  - Command-line interface for database operations
  - Implements handshaking protocol
  - Supports add/list/delete operations

## Technical Implementation

- **Network Protocol**:
  - Custom binary protocol with version negotiation
  - State-based message handling
  - Connection-per-request model

- **Database Engine**:
  - Custom binary file format
  - CRUD operations for employee records
  - Atomic operations with proper error handling

- **Testing Framework**:
  - Automated test suite in Makefile.test
  - Validation of server-client interactions
  - Hexdump verification of database integrity

This project demonstrates solid systems programming skills including:
- Socket programming
- Non-blocking I/O with poll()
- Binary data protocols
- File I/O
- Process management
- Client-server architecture


### Usage Examples

```bash
# Server
$ ./bin/dbserver 
Filepath is a required argument
Usage: ./bin/dbserver -n -f <database_file>
Options:
	-n          create new database file
	-f <file>   (required) database file path
	-p <port>   (required) port to listen on
$ ./bin/dbserver -n -f my.db -p 8080
  DATABASE SERVER STARTED SUCCESSFULLY
  Listening on: 0.0.0.0:8080

  CONNECT CLIENT:
  ./bin/dbcli -h localhost -p 8080
```

```bash
# Client
$ ./bin/dbcli 
Usage: ./bin/dbcli -h <host> -p <port> [-a <addarg>]
Options:
	-h <host>   (required) host to connect to
	-p <port>   (required) port to connect to
	-a <addarg> Add a new employee with the given string format 'name,address,hours'
	-l List all employees in the database
	-d <name>    Delete employee with the given name

## Testing Framework

The Makefile.test provides isolated tests for critical server functionality.


### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make -f Makefile.test test
